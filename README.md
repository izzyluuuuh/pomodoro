### [WHAT IS THE POMODORO¬Æ TECHNIQUE?](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/)

The **Pomodoro¬Æ Technique** is a time management method developed by _Francesco Cirillo_ in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into short, focused intervals called "Pomodoros," which are typically 25 minutes in length, followed by a short break of 5 minutes. The Pomodoro Technique is designed to help individuals _maintain focus, increase productivity, and reduce mental fatigue_. The technique's name comes from the Italian word "pomodoro," which means "tomato," inspired by the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used while developing the technique. üçÖ

**The traditional Pomodoro Technique involves six steps:**

1. Choose a task to be accomplished.
2. Set the Pomodoro timer to 25 minutes.
3. Begin the timer and work on the task without any interruptions.
4. When the timer goes off, mark the Pomodoro as completed and take a short break of 5 minutes.
5. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes.
6. Repeat the process until the task is completed.
